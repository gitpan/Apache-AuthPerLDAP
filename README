     Apache::AuthPerLDAP - mod_perl PerLDAP Authentication Module

DESCRIPTION

     AuthPerLDAP provides Basic Authentication, with
     username/password lookups against an LDAP server, using
     Netscape's PerLDAP kit.

     It is heavily based on Clayton Donley's Apache::AuthLDAP
     module, but uses the newer Netscape PerLDAP (Mozilla::LDAP),
     which in turn uses the Netscape Directory SDK for C. Thus
     Donley's original Net::LDAPapi module and library is no
     longer required.

     It requires mod_perl and PerLDAP (v1.2 or later). Building
     mod_perl with:

     perl Makefile.PL PERL_AUTHEN=1 PERL_STACKED_HANDLERS=1
     PERL_GET_SET_HANDLERS

     works for me. If this module is the only Apache/Perl module
     you are going to use, you probably don't need anything but
     the PERL_AUTHEN hook enabled.

     Unlike Donley's Apache::AuthLDAP module, AuthPerLDAP is only
     used for authentication, and thus only supports the
     require-user directive.  If a user enters the correct
     username and password, the authentication is considered to
     be OK.

CREDITS

     Apache::AuthPerLDAP is greatly inspired by the original
     Apache::AuthLDAP written by Clayton Donley.

     Adoption to PerLDAP was done by reading the PerLDAP source
     and documentation provided by Netscape Corp. and Leif
     Hedstrom, found at www.perldap.org.

     The new book published by O'Reilly & Associates, and
     authored by Lincoln Stein and Doug MacEachern helped clarify
     many mod_perl issues I previously had problems with:
     "Writing Apache Modules with Perl and C" (www.modperl.com).

     Andreas K. Sorensen provided usefull Perl wisdom during
     debugging.
